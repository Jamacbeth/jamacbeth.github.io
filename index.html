        <p>
         Back in 2017, I completed a Network Support program and spent the next eight years working for a company where I wore many hats. For four of those years, I was part of the pilot team—helping launch new programs, test software, and assist third-party companies by onboarding their staff or customers.

           In May 2025, I decided it was time for something new and started a Web Development course. The program covers both front-end and back-end development. So far, I’ve worked on designing websites and mobile apps using Adobe XD, and I’ve started learning version control, collaboration, and the basics of code through GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
              This course has been a big shift from what I was doing before, but it’s been a great experience so far. I’ve enjoyed learning new tools, working on creative projects, and seeing my progress. I’m looking forward to continuing to build my skills and seeing where this leads.
