          Back in 2017, I completed a Network Support program, which introduced me to the foundational concepts of IT infrastructure and support. That experience sparked my curiosity about the technology that powers the web and our connected world.

          Fast forward to May 2025, I began a new journey into web development. This course has allowed me to dive deep into the world of code, design, and collaboration, pushing my creative and technical skills further each day.

          Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and enjoy turning challenges into opportunities. My goal is to build user-friendly, accessible, and visually appealing websites while expanding into full-stack development and graphic design.
